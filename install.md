**Q)** Where do I submit bug reports and feedback?

**A)** [Github issues][gh-issues] is the best,
but emails to [squirt.io.reader@gmail.com](mailto:squirt.io.reader@gmail.com)

<div class="faq" markdown="1">

**Q)** I'm a publisher&mdash;can I embed Squirt on my site?

**A)** Absolutely! The bookmarklet will work as a normal &#60;a&#62; tag&mdash;
you can copy <a class="bookmarklet">this one</a>. Feature requests on [Github][gh-issues]
will encourage me to clean up the code and make it easy to customize.
